Since the Neogrammarians, when linguists write the phonological histories of languages, they essentially write programs (that convert protoforms into reflexes). From a computational perspective, this is an example of “coding by example.” In this project, we seek to answer the question: can we treat comparative reconstruction as a code-generation problem and solve it with LLMs?
