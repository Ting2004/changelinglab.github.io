Blocking is a well-known linguistic phenomenon. In brief, constructions (including words) are dispreferred if there is an already established construction with the same meaning. For example, *childs* is dispreferred as a plural of *child* (even though it follows the regular rule for pluralization in English) because it is “blocked” by the semantically identical word *children*.

In this project, we investigate the hypothesis that LLMs do not display blocking behavior in the same way the humans do.
