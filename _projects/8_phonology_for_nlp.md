The ways in which phonology can be used for NLP ends is underexplored. Members of this lab paved the way for future work in this area with tools like Epitran {% cite mortensen2018epitran %} and PanPhon {% cite mortensen2016panphon %}. We are now seeking to apply phonological representations in a variety of tasks, following the path cleared by {% cite bharadwaj2016phonologically %} and {% cite chaudhary2018adapting %}. We have recently extended this work to modern classes of pretrained models like XPhoneBERT {% cite sohn2024zeroshotcrosslingualnerusing %}. This year, we plan to generalize this investigation to a variety of linguistic tasks (instead of just NER and MT, as in past work) and develop better techniques for exploiting phonological resources.
