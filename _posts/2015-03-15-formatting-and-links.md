Diachronic linguistics is important for the same reason the evolutionary biology is important: you cannot really understand the state of a language at any given time, or why the range of attested languages is what it is, without understanding the mechanisms by which languages come to be.

In computational linguistics, diachrony has often played second fiddle. The focus, during the Age of Rules, was on implementing linguistic formalisms (that captured aspects of language like syntax, semantics, and discourse structure). This reflected the prestige approaches in theoretical linguistics. It also reflected the underlying expectation that, with just a few more rules (or a few more fixes to existing rules), these symbolic systems would be good for something.

Historical linguistics has long lacked the prestige of theoretical syntax and semantics and, at first blush, it is not good for much. Certainly the knowledge of human history and culture that comes from understanding the linguistic past is valuable. However, it is not readily apparent how diachronic linguistics feeds into machine translation, question answering, automatic speech recognition, or any of the other human language technologies that are economically important today.

Certainly, on the margins, historical linguistics can help with a few NLP tasks. For example, historical lingustic relationships (are the resulting similarities in phonology) can be leveraged to faciliate named entity recognition, as we have shown in a few papers. Likewise, phylogentitic information has been used for selecting transfer languages in cross-lingual training. However, it seems unlikely that the next big breakthrough in NLP will be the product of diachronic linguistics (or even linguistics).
